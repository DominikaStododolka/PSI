Mamma Mia! (2008);8;Surprisingly Infectious Fun;14.01.2008;"Abba's music never did much for me as pop songs, but in the context of a musical, they work quite well. There are a couple numbers I think could have been left out, specifically Baranski's ""Does Your Mother Know"" and Streep and Brosnan's ""Winner Takes It All"", but even those weren't bad. The singing is good pretty much across the board. Even the weakest singer, Pierce Brosnan, did a surprisingly good job. His voice has a certain Peter Gabriel quality to it (with a dash of Randy Newman).";yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);9;It Was Brilliant Feel Good Musical At Its Best!!;01.07.2008;I absolutely loved the screen adaptation of Mamma Mia! The look of it was gorgeous, never has a Greek island looked so beautiful! I loved Meryl Streep as Donna, she cam across as an honest and good-hearted character. I loved Amanda ans Sophie and my only big casting problem was Pierce Brosnan, you may want to cover your ears when he sings, he's horrible. Some of the songs seemed a bit forced in the storyline, but some of them felt at home. I saw an advanced screening and the sound wasn't very good but that could have been because of the spot where we were sitting. The movie was ultimate feel good! I loved it! It was very bright and bouncy the whole time. I didn't feel that there was one slow moment in the movie! I think my favorite moment in the movie was definitely Dancing Queen. It was spectacular.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);6,5;A movie that will make you smile;02.07.2008;I loved this movie! It's so much fun, and it's impossible to watch it without smiling. The cast is amazing, and the music is fantastic. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a feel-good movie.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);8;Feel good comedy we Greeks loved it!;05.07.2008;"Went to an open theater last night here in Athens-Greece and all the audience was laughing their hearts out! Who cares about showing a bit of grotesque concerning ""modern Greece,"" i wish the real Greece was as shown in Mamma Mia--all dancing and singing. Awesome! It might look a bit too much of a comedy, but that's the whole point. Just enjoy it,laugh your heart outs, don't' even think about criticizing it and just have a wonderful night with it. Entertaining at its best! When will you ever get a chance to travel to an ideal Greek island with Meryl Streep, Peter Brosnan, Julie Waters etc, all dancing and singing with super high comedy involved. No wannabes here, just chaotic entertainment!";yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);10;fell good movie;06.07.2008;just seen film at odeon Leicester sq real feel good film, Abba music is great (Im a queen Fan) all the audience loved the film dancing and singing along, just like the stage show but better the Greek island setting was great good atmosphere I longed for mythos beer Meryl was good, pierce was good Julie was great take my advice take the wife and just enjoy the film, sit back kick off the shoes and soak up the sun and songs, the story is good not great but it carries the plot along at a good level of enjoyment, the actors seem to enjoy the singing and it was great to see non singing stars sing, I love the Greek islands and this made me want to go back and take ABBA on my ipod to enjoy on the beach and at the bar, all I want now is for We will rock you to come to the screen then my life would be complete.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);8;Take a Chance... It's Surprisingly Brilliant!;08.07.2008;While the majority of the film is brilliantly silly, Meryl Streep gives us an emotional show stopping performance of 'The Winner Takes It All. Who wouldn't pay to see James Bond singing 'SOS'? Pierce Brosnan was humorously over-emoting everything but it worked perfectly within the context of the film.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);6,5;Not for everyone;10.07.2008;I have to be honest, I didn't love this movie. I found the story to be a bit cheesy, and the acting was over-the-top. However, I can see why some people would enjoy it. If you're a fan of ABBA or musicals, then you'll probably like it.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);3;Mamma Mia - Chaotic and Absurd;10.07.2008;"""Mamma Mia"" was artificial and downright contrived – there was no flow with the story, the songs were hardly relevant to the situations, and the song numbers were so unnecessarily long (take ""The Winner Takes It All"" for instance.) There was hardly any conflict – just a lot of miscommunication. It was like a lengthy and overly-acted music video of sorts.";yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);10;Best Surprise of the Year!! (From a none Abba Fan!);12.07.2008;I went to see the film with my girlfriend and wasn't really interested, although it did have a very impressive cast! I LOVED it! What a great surprise, I laughed the whole way through and found myself completely invested in the plot!! The acting, singing and dancing was superb, I honestly believe Streep (who looked fantastic!) could be up for an Oscar.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);4;Cringeworthy;13.07.2008;It's quite a feat for the scenery to steal the show but that's what happens in this dreadful transfer from the stage to film. I tend to avoid musicals apart from the Gilbert and Sullivan type - deliberately tongue in cheek. However, I have a feeling Mamma Mia is a fine stage musical - it just doesn't work when straight actors take the main roles. The piece requires singers primarily as there is very little acting...a bit of dancing is called for but that is typical for a stage musical and there are plenty of performers who specialise in this genre. Streep and Walters are just so wooden it is unbelievable. Brosnan can't sing and Firth, what was he doing there? The daughter character comes over as a 13year old but is supposed to be 20 or so. So silly. This film represents a missed opportunity. The costumes are so much better than the dreadful stuff ABBA really wore, and the Greek island looks really enticing. Other than that there is nothing of merit.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);8;Big, loud, silly and wonderful;13.07.2008;"Mamma Mia!"" is brilliant. Really brilliant. Such a crowd pleaser. An exuberant, energetic, sparking musical, full of timeless songs and a cast (step forward Meryl Streep) who attack their roles with true gusto. Big, loud, silly and wonderful. As bright and camp as Graham Norton and Dale Winton on a night out. Look in any dictionary under the phrase 'Feelgood Movie' and you will see ""Mamma Mia!"" writ large. They should prescribe ""Mamma Mia!"" on the National Health. Fixes all known ills.";yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);7;It's hard not to be drawn in by this film!!;16.07.2008;I heard a cynical reviewer give Mamma Mia a good review and I was intrigued to see whether the film could work the same trick on me. This is the sort of film that I'd generally hate. I'm really into intelligent films that make the viewer think. You couldn't get a film that's further from this genre than Mamma Mia. The plot consists of a soon to be bride trying to work out who is her father from three possible candidates that she discovers from her mothers diary. She invites all three to the wedding in order to find out who her father is. That's it in terms of plot.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);7;Fun and joy-able!;18.07.2008;"When I went to see this movie a week ago, I soon noticed that a majority of the audience were people who most likely listened to ABBA as youngsters. I didn't. I'm a fan of musicals, ever since I saw Moulin Rouge, but just a few minutes into ""Mamma Mia"" I wondered if this really was my scene? Wasn't this kind of silly? But after 15 minutes I was convinced: This wasn't any air headed, dumb musical for a middle aged pop-music-loving audience - this was a super cute, funny and joy-able musical for everyone. My boyfriend, which i dragged to the theater because he claimed he hated Abba, laughed out loud and so did I and the rest of the audience.";yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);7;"It's not the play; get over it and you'll enjoy it.";18.07.2008;"To enjoy this film, it helps to leave some expectations at the door. One is that ""ABBA sound."" This isn't it. That sound was created in a studio with a mixing board, etc. Some of that sound was in the stage play and it worked there because the majority of the audience is far enough from the stage to really think that gorgeous sound is coming from just the cast on stage. But when the camera is right in the actor's face, and that face is several stories high, the music must come from the singer.";yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);7;Fun and joy-able!;18.07.2008;"When I went to see this movie a week ago, I soon noticed that a majority of the audience were people who most likely listened to ABBA as youngsters.

Mamma Mia! (2008);10;Amazing acting, breathe-taking places. Great Singing. Brilliant all round;18.07.2008;"The film was in my opinion Amazing. The actors & actresses acted their roles so well & obviously put a lot of emotion and hard work into the film. The music was brilliant, the singing amazed me! I had no idea to expect what i'd seen. Some scenes have you crying with laughter, others have you in floods of tears, because of the emotion & the lyrics of the songs.. I would definitely recommend you go out & watch this. As soon as it began, i was obsessed. I've been back twice to see it, and I'm planning to go again soon. The music will have you singing along, and seriously trying to resist the urge to stand up and dance. :)
";yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);10;Wonderful;19.07.2008;"I didn't know what to expect when going into watch ""Mamma Mia"", was this gonna be another Hairspray or Across the Universe or Rent? This was a lighthearted, quite enjoyable movie of its own style, Meryl Strep blew the entire audience away with her comedic persona in this movie. After seeing her in Devil Wears Prada, you are shaken momentarily after seeing her climb on top a roof singing ""Mamma Mia!"" and swoon and the dance teenage giddy girl dance. You'll love this movie for trio of older woman characters, they were all so funny. Mr. James Bond's character and singing was such a hilarious delight for the audience, we couldn't believe this was the man who played a top secret spy agent.";yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);1;Utterly dreadful;19.07.2008;"Let's get one thing out of the way first: I used to really like ABBA's music, some of the songs are recognised classics of pop and their place in pop history is assured, but this film (and the stage 'musical' by association) has savaged that legacy. This movie is so contrived, ridiculous, awfully plotted and embarrassing, it should never have seen the light of day; it makes Alvin and the Chipmunks look like high art.";no
Mamma Mia! (2008);7;Cotton candy no good for tummy but sometimes good for heart;19.07.2008;Well -- it wasn't glorious fun, but I left the theater smiling and humming the music. And that's despite Phyllida Lloyd's nearly catastrophic turn as director. Who the hell decided just because somebody's directed a play on a stage they know how to direct a movie? Her clumsiness came damn close to ruining the film...as did the editor, who really must have been on coke at the time or else has a major case of ADD. I think it works better for a musical if you can see the numbers come together as all of a piece and not four-thousand, three-hundred and fifty seven different pieces, like they do on music videos.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);6;Really fun and Worth the price of admission;19.07.2008;We really enjoyed this film because we are big fans of ABBA, Mamma Mia, Meryl Streep, Colin Firth, Julie Waters, Christine Baranski and Pierce Brosnan. The dancing and acting was top notch, but as expected the bride and groom, and MS Baranski were by far the best singers. No one really expected the rest of the cast to be professional singers. The older generation was a bit too old to fit the story line and it was probably a mistake to mention the internet in one scene and then show pictures of a hippy past in the next. But the beauty of Mamma Mia is that the quality of the music is such that the next door neighbors could perform it and the audience would still be dancing in the aisles.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);6;Super Pooper;20.07.2008;Let me tell you. Just because I've been listening to ABBA almost non-stop since I saw MAMMA MIA! two days ago does not mean I enjoyed the film all that much. It's just the Swedish pop super group's music is so darn infectious. You would think that energy would translate to feel-great good time at the movies but sadly this is not the case. First time feature filmmaker, Phyllida Lloyd, spends far too much time dragging her feet when they should be dancing up and down the beach and no matter how many shots of the moonlight shimmering against the waves there are, the film is still a clunker instead of a stunner.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);7;That Just Happened!;20.07.2008;I manned up when my better 1/2 asked to go see this. I didn't put up a fight or whine or make comments I just said sure. I have zero experience with musicals let alone the source material for Mamma Mia! I don't know what I witnessed exactly but im not kidding when I say that I haven't smiled that much for no good reason well ever! You would have to be a sadist to hate this movie. Every performance by the actors made me believe that they were having a ball. Its dumb fun & having seen The Dark Knight the night before im glad I didn't see them back to back! Im pretty sure I would have had an aneurysm. If you cant stand musicals you will hate Mamma Mia but if you don't care one way or another & are open minded do yourself a favor go see it.;yes

Mamma Mia! (2008);5;Serves it purpose;20.07.2008;"With musicals on stage coming out left, right and centre it was no surprise that they would start to put them back into film. With the recent Sweeney Todd film setting the standard for musicals, the Abba musical had a lot to live up to. To start with this was not going to be artful masterpiece that Tim Burton created, this was going to be a feel good movie that was designed to entertain. For this it works, however the story behind this film is quite simply terrible, and the singing isn't up to the standard of the likes of Chicago. Julie Walters and Meryl Streep steal the show completely, they're worth watching and Streep's version of ""The winner takes it all"" is stunning.";no
Mamma Mia! (2008);6;"Halfway through ""The Winner Takes it All"", my resistance finally died";20.07.2008;Don't get me wrong. This is a bad film. The plot is poor and badly carried out. Some of the songs are appalling. Pierce Brosnan cannot sing at all. Colin Firth struggles. Story lines pop out of nowhere. In short, it's badly written, badly directed and has some of the worst singing ever heard in a cinema.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);6;I love this movie with a love bordering on the unnatural;21.07.2008;"I have a confession to make that could land me in serious trouble here. I love this movie with a love bordering on the unnatural. Of course, I hear you saying, that can only mean one thing; you're a gay man of a certain age and if you haven't come out of the closet already, you're coming out now, and wearing sequins at the same time.";yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);7;It knows who it is aiming for and what it has to do;21.07.2008;"However for what it does Mamma Mia is actually very good because it knows who it is aiming for and what it has to do. Yes this means that it is daft and cheesy but that sort of ""big"" cheerfulness is what the target audience want – they want to feel elated and lifted even if it isn't real in any form. In that regard the film delivers as it is built on beautiful colours in the sets and costumes and a cast that put their egos to one side and throw themselves into it.";yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);5;It's definitely a cheesy movie and far from perfect;21.07.2008;It's definitely a cheesy movie and far from perfect, but it's a fun watch with catchy songs (duh, it's ABBA). It's not too long nor too short, so it's a perfect movie to watch when you just want to relax and not think too much.;no
Mamma Mia! (2008);10;True to what it promises: A First-rate Crowd Pleaser;22.07.2008;"So, let me put it that way: Mamma Mia! is one of the most entertaining pieces of cinema that I have seen in a long, long time. Yes, it doesn't have the gorgeous stylization of Moulin Rouge or the raunchiness of Chicago, but in its own way, it's just amazing. The simple presentation is backed up by a fantastic cast, a heartwarming story about love and the meaning of family, and a bunch of beautiful songs. Watching this film was one of the most beautiful movie-going experiences I had; I saw it 3 times in packed theatres, where audiences were quiet when they needed to be, and active and responsive otherwise. In those three times, the first Dancing Queen number got wild applause by the minute it was over, a proof of the entertainment value of the film. And near the end, when Donna looks at the screen and asks why everyone is still there while the credits are rolling, she says ""do you want one more song?"" and the entire audience would scream ""YEAH"". This is a first-rate crowd pleaser; a film that takes you into its world until you feel you are part of it. What an achievement.";yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);8;I don't like musical movies at all, but I have to admit that this movie was good !;22.07.2008;What made the movie enjoyable for me were the music, the visuals, and, surprising to me, Meryl Streep. I usually don't like Streep's movies or her performances. Her films tend to contain subject matter I don't care for, and, often, they are preachy in a way that I find disagreeable. The tendency to underplay a role is normally a desirable quality in an actor. Unfortunately, she underplays to barbiturate levels.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);2;The cinematic equivalent of water boarding;24.07.2008;It was a silly juke box musical on stage, now it's a big, splashy, poorly shot screen juke box musical. If you like ABBA, so-so. If not, an assault on the senses and an insult to whatever intelligence you're left with when you exit the theater. I readily admit that I didn't really want to see this movie and went with some friends who did, but for the love of God. Why does my gender shriek and squeal to convey delight? Ever sit next to a table of women who have had too much to drink and are absolutely determined to have GREAT night out on the town? That's the feeling of this whole project. It just felt so good when it stopped.;no
Mamma Mia! (2008);8;A Joy From Start To Finish!;24.07.2008;However, i left my cinema with a sense of joy at what i had witnessed, not only is this one of the best films of the year, it is possibly one of the best films to come out of the '00's' Meryl Streep, though a little old for her part was as usual, on top form with an amazingly powerful and emotional voice. Her acting, whilst not on a par with The Devil Wears Prada, was excellent.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);6,5;A must-see for fans of ABBA;25.07.2008;If you're a fan of ABBA, then you need to see this movie. It's a love letter to the band, and it's full of their greatest hits. The cast is amazing, and the story is heartwarming. I would definitely recommend it.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);1;Disaster!;25.07.2008;it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Let me think... mm, nope, I'm wrong, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. Think about it, Streep singing and dancing, so Brosnan. (of course if you can consider those funny movements as dancing and awkward sounds as singing.) What can I say? Worst movie and except Amanda Seyfried and Colin Firth, worst cast ever.;no
Mamma Mia! (2008);1;If you want to listen to the music, go buy a CD!;25.07.2008;"My mother and I decided to watch this movie together. We both are ABBA fans and loved the ""Mamma Mia!"" musical. This movie is nothing like it. The one thing that got me was how much everyone seemed to over act. There was so much cheese in it that I wanted some wine, or maybe that was to get past the awful singing! Pierce Brosnan never needs to sing again. He just needs to stand and look pretty. I will respect him for that.";no
Mamma Mia! (2008);1;This is the one that almost got me divorced!!!;29.07.2008;"MY wife ( who never goes to movies) said lets go see Mamma Mia on our 15th wedding celebration and I unwittingly said yes. Now understand I love chick flicks like Sleepless, you've got mail etc. , but I was not prepared for this movie. I looked it up and saw comedy, Pierce Bronson etc and thought ""OH OK'. I will never trust PIERCE again and will read every review before saying OK again. I was in so much pain that a person behind us asked me to stop talking during the show and I was MOANING. Meryl Streep was SINGING. Pierce was screeching. The sound volume was so loud it hurt my ears ( I am hard of hearing) . The only cast member who belonged in this movie was Christine Baranski who kept it from 0.";no
Mamma Mia! (2008);6,5;A fun and frothy musical;30.07.2008;Mamma Mia! is a fun and frothy musical that is sure to please fans of ABBA. The cast is great, the songs are catchy, and the story is lighthearted. It's the perfect summer movie.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);3;Oh dear.........;31.07.2008;Just got back from an afternoon screening of this film. Even though the film has been showing for almost three weeks now, the cinema was PACKED with (mostly) over 50s. Firstly, I am a HUGE fan of ABBA (have been since the early 70s, even before their Eurovision win) and I so wanted to enjoy this film but I'm afraid that I felt like watching it with my hands covering my face and peeking through my fingers, such was my embarrassment! Overacted to the extreme by all concerned it is truly cringeworthy. The dreadful Julie Walters was the usual awful hammy, mugging Mrs. Overall persona that she always is (you may have guessed that I can't STAND this particular 'national treasure'.I really had to force myself to go to see it knowing that this ghastly woman was in it.) The music is actually tolerably sung by most of the cast (with the exception of Pierce Brosnan) but the 'OMG' hystrionics of the actors to show that they are having 'fun' is just appalling. Incidentally, not one person in the cinema laughed at the 'funny' bits. All in all, a miscast (the leads were WAY too old) misfire and one that any discerning cinema goer will find poor.;no
Mamma Mia! (2008);6,5;Feel-good movie of the year;01.08.2008;I have to admit, I'm not a huge fan of musicals, but I was pleasantly surprised by this one. The cast is great, the songs are catchy, and the story is heartwarming. It's the perfect movie to watch when you need a little pick-me-up.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);1;Painful !!!!!;02.08.2008;This is one of the worst films i have ever seen.;no
Mamma Mia! (2008);6;Lots of foot tapping;05.08.2008;We're seeing normally non-musical actors bursting into song and dance. It's just us. Meryl Streep has never seemed to be having so much fun as she does here. Brosnan, Firth, and Skarsgard also clearly relish the chance to do something they haven't done before. Amanda Seyfried. has always shown the kind of spark that suggests a star in the making. This is undoubtedly a breakthrough performance, as she brings charm, sweetness, and charisma to the role of Sophie.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);6;Pales in comparison to the stage production;07.08.2008;"I have seen Mama Mia twice on stage, and it is one of my favorite musicals, so I could barely wait to get to the theater to see it as a full feature film. Unfortunately, the movie was quite disappointing to say the least. I felt the casting of the characters was weak and poorly represented the characters as originally written. Donna was always portrayed as spunky and attractive though overworked and exhausted, and Meryl Streep just didn't have that ""umph"" to her. Pierce Brosnan had the look of Sam, but his singing was terrible. When adapting a musical to the big screen, quality of singing voice should be given more consideration. There are so many amazing actors with phenomenal voices, I can't understand why they didn't cast a little more carefully. There were also songs from the stage production that were not included in the movie including my favorite, ""Thank you for the Music"". I kept waiting for it to be thrown in somewhere along the way, but it was not included at all. While I wouldn't say the movie was terrible, I think if you have seen it live on stage, prepare to be disappointed.";yes

Mamma Mia! (2008);10;"""Mamma Mia!"" Says (Sings) It ALL!";19.08.2008;"""Mamma Mia!"" radiates rainbows of infectious energy, in part owing to its array of ABBA songs. The champagne frothy, transcendental music of ABBA imbues this innocuous movie with lighter-than-helium buoyancy. Indeed, audiences could literally dance in the aisles for the movie seems like a concert with a plot. Director Phyllida Lloyd keeps those few quiet, introspective moments of intimacy to a minimum. Although ""Mamma Mia"" is a chick flick, it is neither a heartbreaker nor a tearjerker. Nobody dies from a sudden bout of cancer. Furthermore, this madcap comedy of errors doesn't have a dull moment. Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgård, Julie Walters, and Christine Baranski must have been dosed up with Ritalin. Rarely do they sit around and talk. They are dancing, singing, and cavorting about a scenic Greek island, and they look like that had a terrific time. What makes ""Mamma Mia!"" so enjoyable is the elaborate way that the ABBA tunes have been worked in to compliment the film's themes. The cast, especially 59-year old Streep, does a great job of belting out chartbusters like ""Super Trouper,"" ""Dancing Queen,"" ""Knowing Me, Knowing You,"" ""Thank You for the Music,"" ""Money, Money, Money,"" ""The Winner Takes It All,"" ""Voulez Vous,"" ""I Have a Dream,"" and ""SOS."" Moreover, the resolution to the mystery of Sophie's dad and the surprises that occur as a result will keep you guessing. If you missed taking a summer vacation, you can take a chance on ""Mamma Mia!"" The lush Greek scenery, the entertaining storyline, and the enchanting performances will transport you out of the doldrums.";yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);7;fun feel good movie;19.08.2008;Besides being visually pleasing...the cast was superb. Meryl streep is such an amazing actress, so diverse and never disappointing. Colin firth as the 'spontaneous' hippie is hilarious. and pierce Bronson is fabulously handsome and romantic . the music was also great fun, made me feel like i was watching a bollywood movie.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);10;Simply amazing!;12.09.2008;"Well, what can i say? This movie is one of the best movies i've seen in on a big screen so far! I don't particularly like musicals, but man this one is awesome! All the songs that have been chosen for it are great and popular so it was no surprise that all the time the audience was singing along with the actors :) The whole time the faces of the people around me were lightened up with a smile and everyone was happy! Me..... i had the chills going down my spine pretty much most of the time :) No one stood up before the final credits were shown and everybody was simply sitting down listening to the music, happy by the unexpected joy this movie brought them ;) I strongly recommend this piece to everyone regardless of age and genre preferences, cause i really believe that this movie is so good that there's no way not to fall in love with it! :)";yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);9;Feel Good Movie of the Year;16.09.2008;This movie is great fun and I can't believe all the people and critics complaining about the lame plot and lack of character development, This is Mama Mia what the heck. It's fast paced and fun. Highly recommended.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);10;Frivolous fun!;26.09.2008;Okay, so here we have an entirely implausible storyline shaped into unashamedly enjoyable cinema experience. Personally, I hate going to movies, just because they are so expensive these days. I went to see this one twice... People in the audience were laughing out loud, clapping and enjoying themselves. Isn't that what we go to the movies for, to be entertained? Admittedly, Pierce Brosnan can't sing... so what? He was a ton of fun. The leading ladies (Streep, Walters and Baranski) seemed to be having such a good time... there is not much sexier than mature women having fun and being the mature women they are... The characters looked and acted seasoned, which was quite refreshing.;yes

";29.09.2008;I can't stop singing the musics and remembering the scenes.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);7;Aren't the actors too old?;05.10.2008;It really was a wonderful movie. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Great cast, and I loved the musical selections. I sang along and knew most of the words. Amanda Seyfried was just lovely, and very talented.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);9;Wonderful nostalgia;07.10.2008;It's so amazing to see the chemistry between Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan, her performance as Donna is so cool, cheerful, full of life and also touching but not overwhelming, she raised her daughter Sophy as a single mom struggling with financial issues but never lose faith and optimism managing a small resort place somewhere in the mystic Greece. I enjoyed to watch this movie with one of my best friends, both of us are married and have family, we shared a little space of time for going to the movies and have a good time with Mamma Mia, we sang, we laughed and we also remembered wonderful times with those timeless songs of Abba. Excellent choice with Meryl Streep, I can't imagine this film without her and Pierce Brosnan was surprising when he sang.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);8;Fun! Fun! Fun!;09.10.2008;"I get a kick out of all the people that come on this board to bash this movie when clearly they don't like musicals by their own admission. That would be like me critiquing a horror film - I despise horror films so it would be hard for me to find anything redeeming about one. So why people insist on seeing a film in a genre that they knowingly do not like or appreciate, and then proceed to criticize it, is beyond me! Anyway, regarding the movie - Here's the good: 1) The location and cinematography - absolutely breathtaking! It makes a person want to seriously consider Greece as their next vacation destination. I'm sure the Board of Tourism in Greece couldn't be happier with this film. 2) Singing talent - while many have roundly criticized the choices for the leads in this film, I find the fact that Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan and a few others aren't trained singers rather endearing. In fact, I found Meryl Streep's rendition of ""Slipping Through My Fingers"" more emotional than any stage version I've seen and even the original song. And to improve upon Agnetha Faltskog's voice/version is a tall order indeed! The young actor/singer who plays Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is beautiful and has a lovely, angelic voice. Visually, she is a believable casting choice to play Meryl Streep's daughter and I thought they had good on-screen mother-daughter chemistry. 3) The Plot - Yes, it's thin and silly and frothy, but that's what makes it so fun! I mean, think about it. Any time you watch a musical, you have to suspend disbelief. When in real life does anyone ever belt out a song and dance in the middle of a conversation (with backup singers to boot)? And besides, who amongst any of this film's viewers doesn't know and understand the fact that this plot was created from stringing a number of unrelated ABBA tunes together? Since the process of matching music to the plot is reversed from the normal way, I'm amazed that they were able to create as cohesive a story as they did. 4) The dancing bachelor party boys - Yea! the film left the flipper-flaunting boys (from the stage version) in the scene for ""Lay All Your Love on Me"". I looked around the theater when the boys first appeared and I couldn't find a single person who was not laughing or at least grinning from ear to ear!";yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);10;My, My What A Movie!!!;10.10.2008;Being such a huge ABBA fan, I went with my WHOLE family - there were 13 of us (plus kids) and we all had a really good time.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);1;Mamma Mia is trivial, superficial and left me numb.;24.10.2008;I cannot remember a more trivial, mind numbing and shallow film in other words a real chick flick of the worst kind. How can anyone watch this film and recommend it to others ? Only if they don't like admitting they made a mistake. It seems to summarise the worst of female aspirations. No real substance to it all happy and shallow. Yeah that'll please the masses. Well not this member of the masses. What a trivial load of drivel. I wanted to leave the cinema within 5 minutes of the start. And to think I paid £7 to see this ! I think this does however represent the dumbing down of cinema as with most media these days. So I like a bit of reality in my musicals call me sad or what ?;no
Mamma Mia! (2008);9;You will need Onomatopoeia to describe the Euphoria of this movie;26.10.2008;"Those Doodley-Doodley-Do, Dippy-ti-Dippy-ti-Du melodies, combined with a Humpty-Dumpty tiny precious lyrics, made my brain wonder ""Uh-Huh"" in surprise, and my lips to mutter ""Oh-WOW"" in amazement until my mouth burst in ""Ah - Hah - Ha-Ha-Ha"" happy girlie giggle. That's when my heart started going Rum-Tum-Tum along the bas-line, my pulse started jumping Bum-Bum-Bum in the tact with the disco rhythm, my skin started itch-itch-itching from those pulsations, my stomach started hush-hush-hushing down the noisy butterflies but it couldn't stop my soul from screaming ""Hip-Hip-Hooray"" and ""Yippie-Yippie-YEAH"" from the immense joy and pleasure! Simply amazing...";yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);7;Just like ABBA's music, you'll either really like or just hate this movie.;02.11.2008;Right after having seen this movie I still feel like I could go either way on it. I could completely pick this movie apart and blast it for its silly story, weak directing and whatever more but truth is that this movie is simply harmless fun, that you can either hate on or just surrender yourself to.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);9;Incredible, unexpected;14.11.2008;"What a wonderful film. I can't write in English all the feelings that this film makes me feel. I don't know who's the responsible of the excellence: the writer (Bill Goldman agrees that) the director, the actors, the music, the production designer... but don't matter. The film makes me laugh, cry, feel, sing, dance... and think. I believe that to make a musical film with a high percent of time singing and dancing is not an easy job in the time of our days. Endue a continuity, a story, to a collection of independent and existing songs seems to me an incredible ""tour de force"". And the filmmakers achieve this with success. I know that this kind of film can't be ""Citizen Kane""... Or yes?";yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);10;One Hell of a Trip Down the Aisle.......;20.11.2008;Think of an amusement park or fairground ride, that catches your attention, and draws you to it. You get on, the ride starts, the excitement builds, and off you go. It holds you entranced, the rush is incredible! Then suddenly you realize that it has finished, time to get off. Really, you have only one choice: to get back on it again. That pretty much sums up Mamma Mia! Despite all the hype, I was not disappointed-no way! Forget any negative comments you might have heard about Pierce Brosnan's singing ability. THe more you watch, the better he gets, (an acquired taste, perhaps!) I have one recommendation though: See it on a big screen.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);7;Love, music & a good story conquer all;09.12.2008;First and most importantly: Those ABBA people are great songwriters. The storyline is compelling, good-feeling and tugs on the right heartstrings…enough to overcome the disappointments which mostly involve the casting of well-known and well-loved but non-musical performers in musical roles. Further casting issues: actors who are older than the parts they are playing and a lack of chemistry which kept me from believing the story.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);7;Mamma Mia!;13.12.2008;"Although ""Mamma Mia!"" is full with many imperfections, it brings so much happiness that you get out from the cinema desiring to dance and sing the tunes you've just listened during the film, and I think this is a very positive aspect in these trying times. Abba's songs are crystalline and joyous, and they still maintain their potential also in this film, in which, let's admit it, not everybody can sing (Pierce Brosnan wasn't born to sing, and even Meryl Streep hasn't an unforgettable voice, but the newcomer Amanda Seyfried is quite OK according to me). All in all, the best things in this film are: the character of Tanya (Christine Baranski is so funny!), the ""Dancing Queen"" scene with that fantastic choreography, and the paradise island setting of this story.";yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);7;Surprisingly Good;16.12.2008;"Mamma Mia is not your typical ""female"" movie. It is a nice, refreshing film that is a lot of fun to watch. It does not have the typical female movie aspects of two horrible characters you cannot stand (As Good As It Gets) or two characters who despise each other yet somehow get together (Message in a Bottle)--it is an old time romantic musical that intelligently brings the aspects of Abba's music into the storyline. The characters are portrayed very well, though a few of them are not the greatest singers. The storyline is well thought out and written. The direction is well paced and nicely done. The scenery is gorgeous and adds to the story. It is an overall nice film that you can sit down with the family and watch.";yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);6;Should have been a lot better;31.12.2008;I love Abba's music, and looked forward to this movie - what a let down! The movie makers here were just out to make a fast buck, and don't have a single clue as to the reason for Abba's popularity.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);1;My my how can I resist it? Quite easily actually....;31.12.2008;"Of course objective criticism is a bit of a waste of time as those of us who think that good Cinema should at least be about films having a decent plot, well cast actors and decent production and direction may soon be in a minority. Those of us who suggest that on the evidence of the success of Mamma Mia that it is final proof of the maxim that nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the public are likely to be seen as elitist killjoys. Well so be it – I'm not going to dilute my crucial faculties just because the public votes with its feet and its money to crown Mamma Mia as worthwhile entertainment. Never mind the quality feel the width of the box office takings! But, for what its worth – and that's probably not much, here is a brief list of the reasons why Mamma Mia is such excreta. The plot is trivial, unbelievable, ill-constructed, offensive and just plain dull. The casting is dire. True Meryl Streep is wonderful – but when has she ever not been? But Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth are wooden throughout and they can't sing – and no this is not irony or even remotely funny. It's a MUSICAL. The leads must be able to sing. Doh! Amanda Seyfried can sing and she's very pretty too. But what about those bloody teeth? Sorry this may be a bit from left field but why would a nice little 20 year-old have to have shining white and 100% artificial looking brilliant white teeth. It made her look like an American Ryder Cup wife for goodness sake! Stellan Skarsgard (who?) was dull and he couldn't sing either. Julie Waters gave us one of her batty old ladies – we've seen it before Jules and it made no sense in Mamma bloody Mia. Christine Baranski was good – almost in the Streep class but surely a film with this budget could have cast all of the principals rather more thoughtfully? The editing was woeful as well. There seemed to be a good few gaffes that should have been edited out and reshot – did nobody care or not think that we'd notice when an actor forgets their lines? And was that set meant to look realistic – or the extras look like real people? Maybe not. And maybe on stage it wouldn't matter. But it wasn't on stage – it's a movie! Musical Theatre only really transfers well to film when it is opened out. Think ""Sound of Music"" or ""Carousel"" or ""My Fair Lady"". Mamma Mia was claustrophobic despite the stock shots of the Aegean. It looked more like Pinewood. It was Pinewood! OK so ABBA write catchy songs and we all like occasionally to hum along with them. But why put them into a stage show with a supposed plot in the first place. Why not just perform them as song and dance in concert? And if you must try and make a facile piece of drama around a random collection of songs and put it on stage then please don't later think that it will make a film. But you have – and a few rich people have become even richer as a result. And the Cinema is the poorer for it.";no
Mamma Mia! (2008);1;Sorry but where have all your critical faculties gone?;02.01.2009;Having avoided seeing the movie in the cinema, but buying the DVD for my wife for Xmas, I had to watch it. I did not expect much, which usually means I get more than I bargained for. But 'Mamma Mia' - utter, utter cr**. I like ABBA, I like the songs, I have the old LPs. But this film is just terrible. The stage show looks like a bit of a musical, but this races along with songs hurriedly following one another, no characterisation, the dance numbers (which were heavily choreographed according to the extras on the DVD) are just thrown away with only half the bodies ever on screen, the dance chorus of north Europeans appear on a small Greek island at will, while the set and set up of numbers would have disgraced Cliff Richard's musicals in the sixties!Meryl (see me I'm acting)Streep can't even make her usual mugging effective in an over-the-top musical! Her grand piece - 'The Winner Takes It All' - is Meryl at the Met! Note to director - it should have been shot in stillness with the camera gradually showing distance growing between Streep and Brosnan! Some of the singing is awful karaoke on amateur night. The camera cannot stop moving like bad MTV. One can never settle down and just enjoy the music, enthusiasm and characters. But what is even worse is how this botched piece of excre**** has become the highest grossing film in the UK and the best selling DVD to boot? Blair, Campbell and New Labour really have reduced the UK to zombies - critical faculties anyone???;no
Mamma Mia! (2008);1;Evil.;05.01.2009;"I honestly cannot stress enough how evil and awful this pitiful excuse for a film is. Absolutely none of the actors can sing so it feel like your eardrums are being attacked by a cheese grater. I may sound like I'm exaggerating, and I wish I was, but this movie really is painfully bad. Even if you love musicals, avoid this picture like the plague. I would actually recommend you staple your ear to a donkey as it would probably be less painful. Please, please; for your own sake, save your ears the torture and watch 'The Dark Knight' instead.";no
Mamma Mia! (2008);7;Could be better, but not a total failure either;16.01.2009;I have heard several people refer to it as a 'girly' piece, and I, for the most part, agree. There seems to be two main characters and their respective story lines: a mother worrying about her daughters wedding and about the three guests, all of whom might be the father (it's a bit hard to explain), and the daughter trying to find out about her father. The mother has two friends (rather well played) who help her out in these situations while engaging in casual fun of their own while staying on the mother's island.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);1;A Stinker of a Movie;23.01.2009;This is the worst movie I have seen in the last five years. If you think ugly Americans stinking it up in a foreign country is bad, you should see these Brits ruining a picturesque little slice of Greece. Everybody acts like they're drunk and having a grand old time-- it's excruciating to watch. Nobody can sing. Meryl Streep has done somber, depressed roles in the past that are really good, but she is just terrible in this movie. I hope this doesn't mean she has lost her ability to pick good roles for herself. This movie felt like the actors got on board because they thought it would be great fun to have a party in Greece, but they forgot they had to make a movie.;no
Mamma Mia! (2008);7;It's NOT The Sound of Music, That's for Sure!;10.02.2009;Call me silly, but The Sound of Music is still my favorite musical and the film by which I judge all musicals and Mama Mia sure comes up short. All I kept thinking during the movie was why Julie Andrews wasn't the female lead? Meryl Streep? I LOVE Meryl Streep, but not in Mama Mia! She is the miscast of the year in this role and she CANNOT sing! Nor can Pierce Bronsan or anyone else for that matter except the two young leads who are both knock-outs - both to look at and to listen to. Colin Firth, my very favorite male lead, was the only singer who moved me to tears and he can't sing either. I kept thinking why have they made a musical without singers? What am I missing? But there's so much about this film that annoyed me. First of all, the story is the least romantic I have ever come across. The idea that a young woman on the day of her wedding wants the three men her mother hooked up with and one of whom may be her father is not only silly, it's just plain neurotic, hardly the basis for a romantic story. Okay, so the location shooting was fabulous, but the actors paled in comparison, all of them looking terrible except for the two young leads who looked fantastic! Merly Streep especially looked positively gruesome. All I kept thinking was that the director must HATE Meryl Streep to have her photographed so poorly. But the men didn't look any better especially Pierce Bronsan. The choreography was incredible, no doubt about it, but there were way too many songs and entirely too much motion - everyone on Earth got into the act every time there was a song to be sung - people coming from every direction so that it looked like the entire world was dancing, which might not be such a bad idea, but NOT in a movie, especially when you're trying to follow what little there is of the story.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);1;Weak Script, Shallow Characters - Just Abysmal;08.03.2009;"Unlike ""Grease"" or ""Chicago"", the characters are not fully developed and are left with little or no substance. The tale itself is just as shallow, dotted with story lines that virtually spring up out of nowhere to bring about its end. Maybe if the characters didn't burst into song every few seconds, we'd get to know them and a true, definitive story would be allowed to develop.";no
Mamma Mia! (2008);4;Don't believe the hype;17.03.2009;Really, don't believe the hype. This film is really a major disappointment. I wasn't particularly looking forward to it but was prepared to be pleasantly surprised. Unfortunately my scepticism was entirely justified. What on earth was Meryl Streep thinking of? To say nothing of Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgaerd and Julie Walters.;no
Mamma Mia! (2008);2;Are you kidding me?;20.03.2009;Sadly, this movie is a huge disappointment. I'm searching for the right words without being too critical, but frankly, they don't exist. No plot, no (singing) talent, and no satisfactory ending. Hard to believe Meryl Street, Pierce Brosnan, and Colin Firth stooped to this level. Without them the movie would have been laughed out of Hollywood;no
Mamma Mia! (2008);7;Good Songs!;14.07.2009;I'd definitely give this ten out of ten for the songs but I feel that the storyline wasn't very good at all! Julie Walters is hilarious in this but i feel that the film has but a bad reputation to both Abba and their songs. I also fail to recognise why Colin Firth was gay. What was the point? Furthermore I think that wasn't that a waste of a good actor? I did love the setting though - the Greek Island took my heart away. The beach looked gorgeous and it looked incredibly warm. I have nothing against the actors I thought they were all amazing, their voices were great I just think that comparing such great songs to quite a rubbish story failed to impress me!;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);7;Entertaining and Forgettable;13.11.2009;"""Mamma Mia!"" is an entertaining and forgettable musical that has an interesting idea but a foolish story. ABBA was a successful Swedish pop music group from the early 70's to the early 80's, and the screenplay uses the lyrics of some of their most popular songs along the story entwined with dialogs. Therefore, for fans of this group, it is a plus. Another good point is the always wonderful Meryl Streep. Last but not the least, the paradisiacal locations in Greek islands is another great attraction of this feature. Unfortunately the shallow story is too silly and the choreography is very poor and could be better and better. In the balance of pros and cons, my vote is seven.";yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);1;Do not take a chance on this one!;22.11.2009;"ABBA, Abbacadraba, I want to reach out and grab you! Why? In vengeance for the cinematic torture you put me through in experiencing the film adaption of the ABBA inspired musical ""Mamma Mia"". This asinine film stars Meryl Streep as Donna Sheridan, a rundown Greek hotel owner whose daughter Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is planning her upcoming nuptials in the Greek island. The primary ""Who is my real Pappa?"" premise of this film is that Sophie was never informed by Mamadonna who her real father is, even though there are three main candidates who Mamadonna went over the sexual borderline with twenty years ago. Sophie's choice then is to invite all three to the wedding so she can finally have ""faith"" to know the ""father figure"" truth. These Sophie Daddy nominees are the ""I still love Donna even though I dumped her after I did her"" Sam, the former hippie but now stable banker Harry, and the free spirit boat-aficionado Bill. Along for the wedding ride are also Donna's best friends: the lunatic Rosie, and the middle-aged lush Tanya. Throughout all this ""Who is your daddy?"" humdrum plot there are spurts of these characters singing away to ABBA tunes. All I can say is, to quote a classic ABBA hit- ""Gimme Gimme Gimme"" less of these ridiculous musical scenes; even though Meryl Streep's pipes were not as bad as I thought coming from a seasoned actress. I cannot say the same for The Three Dads who were Pierce Brosnan as Sam, Colin Firth as Harry, and Stellan Skarsgard as Bill. Brosnan was the main singing daddy here and his musical voice was undoubtedly both shaken & stirred. Let's just say that Brosnan's singing was ""The Matador"" to my ears. The ensemble acting of ""Mamma Mia"" was appalling but the ""main weapons of acting destruction"" were found in the performances of Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya. Catherine Johnson's screenplay of ""Mamma Mia"" was dreary & wearisome, and Phyllida Lloyd's direction was as clumsy as direction can get. Harris Zambarloukos' unauthentic cinematography seemed like he used a Greece Photoshop software program for the film's look. So to cap this monstrosity of a film in musical fashion, I will use an ABBA tune: Do not ""take a chance"" on the musical horror of ""Mamma Mia"". *Failure";no
Mamma Mia! (2008);6;Disappointing but worth watching;18.04.2010;I really wanted to see Mamma Mia! as I love Meryl Streep, I love Julie Walters, I love musicals and I love ABBA. The film does have some very good things, but there were some disappointments as well.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);6;A feel good movie but annoying. Stick to the 2018 version;26.12.2010;I may have did a review of this year's ago back in 2010 but I decided to watch it again. Mamma Mia is an ABBA musical starring Meryl Streep,Amanda Seyfried,Dominic Cooper,Pierce Brosnan Colin Firth and tells the tale of a young woman named Sophie played by Amanda Seyfried who's getting married to her long lived boyfriend Sky played by Dominic Cooper. But Sophie has one problem...she has no idea who her real father is. Could it be Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth or Stellan Skarsgard?;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);3;One of those half-mad stage ideas which makes for a predictably dreadful film...;24.01.2011;"Perky' times two thousand... Ecstatic young woman on the Greek island of Kalokairi, living in the ramshackle hotel owned by her single mother, invites three strange men to her upcoming wedding--all of whom shared intimate nights with her mom some twenty years ago, resulting in her conception. So the big question is: which of the trio is the girl's biological father? And when will the prospective bride admit she stole her mother's diary and invited these lackluster would-be dads without mamma's permission? Unctuous, fatuous movie-adaptation of the international stage musical, which utilizes pop songs from the oeuvre of Swedish super-group ABBA to create its reedy-thin 'plot'. ABBA truly did record some beautifully-crafted, catchy and imaginative hits in the late-'70s, but the music as rendered here seems plastic and useless. Meryl Streep, with no character to play, hams it up; she's so professional and refined a presence that this not-inexplicably goofy approach just manages to squeak by, however her co-stars aren't so fortunate. As Streep's daughter, Amanda Seyfried bops around like a squealing teenager in a toothpaste commercial; by the time she and her fiancé are crawling towards each other on the beach singing ""Lay All Your Love On Me"", one is apt to make a mad dash for the exit. The picture is lousy, but it isn't offensive--it's far too innocuous and eager-to-please to be a complete debacle. To get angry over a movie like this would be pointless--it would be like flogging a sponge. The bloated production feasts on glittering aerial shots of the Greek isle, while the cast is continually directed to leap from boats and foot-bridges into the water. At least they don't sing underwater! *1/2 from ****";no

Mamma Mia is one of the happiest movies I've ever seen. it puts you in such a good mood and it is so Real and so energetic, and Abba is a great band and seeing their songs in a movie with a story built around it is one of the most clever ideas ever! A lot of people will criticize the movie but don't listen to it because it really is one hell of a good time. and it isn't a chick flick like many people think! it is a movie that everyone will love and there's something in it for all types of people! in my opinion a five star movie!;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);10;The Best Music!!!!!;25.02.2012;The winter of 2010-2011 in Minnesota was very long and the worst I can remember. I bought Mamma Mia and ended up watching it three times that weekend. For the next two weekends, I had Mamma Mia parties for guy and girlfriends, with Greek and Swedish food. We sang the entire score! When bad weather traps you inside, there is no better uplifting fun than this movie. Everyone has their favorite song, but mine is the guitar ballad on the boat by Colin Firth. I never really paid attention to ABBA years ago when they were popular(even though I'm of Swedish decent), but somehow, I knew almost every one in the movie. I understand that ABBA is coming out with a revival album in 2012 and I can't wait. I actually met Benny Andersson when he was in Minneapolis at the American Swedish Institute's party, maybe that was in 2005.;yes

ABBA songs thrown randomly into a movie and sung by people who should never attempt to sing does not a musical make. The songs are supposed to have something to do with the story; but this story was garbage too. It should have been called ""I'm a mindless, immature girl who idolizes my mother for being an addlepated tramp"". I'll admit I'm not a fan of Meryl Streep, but watching her over-act and fumble her way through this was painful. Actually, watching everyone in this was painful; even the usually good actors failed miserably. The whole production came off as if done by toddlers; the script was awful, the story was awful, the camera work was awful, the acting, singing and dancing was awful. I bought the DVD because I don't really like going to movie theaters, and I chucked it into the Goodwill donation bag immediately after watching it. A complete waste of time and money.";no

Mamma Mia! (2008);7;greece;18.05.2020;The plot is simple, but happy, the scenery in Greece is great, I like it.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);10;Pure happiness, that is all and that is enough.;10.07.2020;This movie is two hours of music and happiness. This movie is an easy 11/10 method of being happy and one of my all time favourites. There is no ingenious plot or thought provoking question, and that's fine. Just sing along and enjoy.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);7;Light Weight Time Waster;10.02.2021;Want high cinema? This isn't your film. Want a bit of good natured fun? Then enjoy. Sure Pierce can't sing, but Meryl sure can. It's fun.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);7;mamma mia!;12.02.2022;I didn't use to like this movie, but as I got older I started to love the movie more. It's definitely a cheesy movie and far from perfect, but it's a fun watch with catchy songs (duh, it's ABBA). It's not too long nor too short, so it's a perfect movie to watch when you're feeling down or to watch with friends on a movie-night.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);10;Amazing;05.04.2024;“Mamma Mia should be studied in school… Superb mixing of the songs with the script… The bonding between Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried really feels like a mother and daughter bond.”;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);6;A.S.A.S. = Abba Songs Always Slap;16.08.2024;This star-studded musical movie is purely vibes, which is not a negative when the vibes are IMMACULATE! Full of Abba bops and heavily saturated shots of Greece, this is the perfect watch for a relaxing summer day.;no
Mamma Mia! (2008);7;"Not a bad musical!
";09.12.2024;My friend showed this to me and it actually brought a smile to my face! While I typically don't gravitate towards musicals and while there could've been a bit more focus on the main character instead of the supporting characters, this one was executed quite well in a few scenes with its dancing sequences and musical numbers. I liked seeing Piers Brosnan as one of the possible fathers, always a good presence on screen for the audience. Meryl Streep also did well and I'm surprised at how well her and her friends moved in certain maneuvers for being their age! Dancing as an older woman can't be easy on the bones and muscles but they did it enthusiastically and convincingly in many parts!;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);10;Absolute masterpiece and all time classic;04.04.2025;Absolute masterpiece and all time classic. The millennials did not appreciate it when it came out but they certainly are turning around as they get older! I even prefer this movie's album and song versions over many of the original Mamma Mia stage show songs, and I own both albums. The sets, the cast, it's all iconic and this movie is ageing like fine wine.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);10;MAMMA MIA IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE;27.05.2025;The chemistry... the soundtrack and Greece… the vibes are immaculate.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);10;Absolutely timeless!;27.05.2025;he energy along with the top tier songs made this definitely at the top of the musical charts.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);4;A Pretty Missfire;08.07.2208;Relentless like one of those loud action movies. The entire cast seems to be on speed. I didn't quite get the director's intentions if any. I wonder if she's ever seen a Stanley Donen, Vincent Minnelli or even a George Sidney musical. Structure, please! This is one hell of a mess and I loved Abba. The costumes the unflattering photography - unflattering towards the actors but loving towards the locations) The one thing that makes the whole thing bearable is the sight of Meryl Streep making a fool of herself. No chemistry with her friends (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) think of Streep with Lily Tomlyn in the Altman film and you'll understand what I was hoping for. I was embarrassed in particular by Pierce Brosnam and Colin Firth. The audience, however, seemed to enjoy it so it probably it's just me.;no
Mamma Mia! (2008);10;Fun film - Don't take it seriously;5.0.2014;This is feel good, have a drink with it, have a sing, don't take it seriously, just laugh and have fun.;yes
Mamma Mia! (2008);8;Experience the joy of one of the great movie musicals ever!;6.08.205;"Of course, there's a lot of people who admitted to laughing every time that Pierce Brosnan attempted to sing, but do you expect James Bond to sing like Howard Keel? Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgård do better with their singing parts, while the younger actors are obviously trained as singers. It seems like every time you blink, somebody is breaking into an Abba song, and while some of the songs seem sort of forced into the plot, for the most part it works. There are also moments when the music becomes so passionate that pure joy takes over and this literally explodes on screen when the weakened structure of Streep's gorgeous inn explodes with a watery fountain from the sea beneath. It's ironic that the biggest hit musicals of Broaday shows are the light-hearted comedies, and ""Mamma Mia!"" deserves its place as one of the best of the past 20 years.";yes
